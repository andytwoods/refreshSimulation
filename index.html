<div id="myText">The problem is as follows. A typical monitor refreshes 60-120 times a second, the time between refreshes being 1000/60 = 16.667 ms. If you want to show your participant a stimulus for only a very brief period, with traditional lab-based software, algorithms sync up when a screen refresh occurs with the presentation of the stimulus. Indeed, in DMDX, the shortest duration stimuli are even specified in ‘ticks’, or the time between intervals.<br>
On the web, however, there is currently no way for the browser or for Flash to know exactly when a refresh is going to happen, and thus no way of syncing the display of stimuli to the screen refresh.<br>
The end result, we don't know with precision how long a short duration stimulus will be shown for, or when it will start/end.<br><br>
Try playing with paramaters of the simulation! I'm really surprised how quick javascript is for such things! Shame JS is rather ugly when it comes to Object Orientated Programming, which makes code readability not great. Code here https://github.com/andytwoods/refreshSimulation.
